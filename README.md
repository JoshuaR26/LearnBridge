# LearnBridge
Bridging the Gap Between You and A World of Knowledge!

--- ABOUT THE PROJECT ---

Learn Bridge is a Google Developer Student Club (GDSC) website project that was created for the Google Solution Challenge 2023. Learn Bridge aims to provide quality education to all the students around the world. While doing so, we also try to bridge them to one another to help them study together efficiently by pooling their resources and knowledge.

However, quality education is not the only necessity required by students. The well being of their health and mental state is also a crucial thing to keep in mind. So, Learn Bridge also provides the help that the students may need by providing them articles hand-picked by students themselves that they found to be helpful.
