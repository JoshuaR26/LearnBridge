It's about creating a better work-life balance. Some companies – and even entire countries – have really taken this to heart and are starting to introduce four-day working weeks. Iceland, for example, trialled a four-day working week between 2015 and 2019 and dubbed the trial an “overwhelming success.” Importantly, productivity levels at the companies involved in the trial either stayed the same or improved – showing that productivity isn't about how much time you spend working but how you spend that time. Today, 86 per cent of Iceland's workforce are already working fewer hours (without taking a pay cut) or will be entitled to do so.</p></button></a>

                    We all get the same 24 hours – so why do some people seem to achieve more with their time than others? The answer: good time management.
                    
                    Time management is the process of organizing and planning how to divide your time between different activities. Get it right, and you'll end up working smarter, not harder, to get more done in less time – even when time is tight and pressures are high.
                    
                    The highest achievers manage their time exceptionally well. And by using Mind Tools' time-management resources, you too can make the most of your time – starting right now!</p></button></a>

                    <p>We all have moments where our social skills fail us. Perhaps your joke was greeted with awkward silence. Or, at a restaurant, you enthusiastically told the waiter that they, too, should enjoy their meal. 

                    The odd mishap with friends is hardly cause for alarm. The embarrassment will soon transform into an inside joke, deeping your bond with others.
                    
                    But, if you fumble too often, it can take a toll on your self-esteem and mental health. If you don't know how to improve your social skills, it can hold you back socially and at work. Some behaviors can come across as antisocial or even harmful to others, while simple shyness can read as aloof, standoffish, or arrogant. Knowing this might not put you at ease, but it can help you understand other people's reactions.</p></button></a>
