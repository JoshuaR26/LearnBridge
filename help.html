                Hey there, Prem here!
                <br><br>
                Just like you, I'm a student who has or is going through the same stuff that you are going through at one or the another point in my life. Whether it be exams, assignments or some random unnecessary quiz that your faculty insists on, academics can be pretty stressful. Mental well-being is undisputably more important than outdoing "Sharmaji ka beta". It's good to reach out for help when this stress builds up too much. 
                <br><br>
                Although I am no expert and can't offer you much help through this screen, what I can I do is recommend you some videos and articles that I found very helpful.<br><br>I hope these help you out too!

                    Ragging is a form of bullying where seniors humiliate or harass new entrants to an institution. It may involve practical jokes or just outright abuse, either of which might affect the victim greatly. It is a prominent problem faced by new entrants. This distasteful practice is seen as an "initiation to the real world" by the seniors. If at any point, you have faced ragging, then do not hesitate to report the culprit to your higher authorities.<br><br>For more information on ragging and how to deal with it, <a href="https://www.antiragging.in/" target="_blank">Click Here</a>.

                    Depression is a very major mental health issue, wherein a person loses all interest in any kind of activity or undergoes emotions such as sadness, hopelessness, emptiness among others. Depression results from a complex interaction of social, psychological, and biological factors. You may have undergone something in the past or are going through something right now; either ways, help is always round the corner.

Living in a hostel far away from home, being thrust into a competitive environment all by yourself, it is completely understandable if you are feeling stressful. Knowing how to manage stress is a very important asset that every student should possess. Academic stress is a prevalent problem among students.

Discover what you can do to keep the worry at bay.'The stress response (fight/flight) is vital for human existence as it alerts us that something is wrong. It gives us the opportunity to act and respond,' says Alison Simmons, mental health and counselling manager at the University of Chester.

                    Roughly 30% of the teens reported feeling overwhelmed, depressed, or sad because of their stress.1
                    
                    Stress can also affect health-related behaviors. Stressed students are more likely to have problems with disrupted sleep, poor diet, and lack of exercise. This is understandable given that nearly half of APA survey respondents reported completing three hours of homework per night in addition to their full day of school work and extracurriculars.</p></button></a>

                    <p>University can be a stressful experience, as well as being fun and exciting. You may feel stressed about starting university, exams, coursework deadlines, living with people you do not know, or thinking about the future.

                    Stress is a natural feeling, designed to help you cope in challenging situations. In small amounts it can be good, because it pushes you to work hard and do your best, such as during exams.
                    
                    But if you're feeling very stressed or feel you cannot manage stress, it can lead to mental health problems such as depression and anxiety. It can also affect your academic performance.
                    
                    Leaving home to start your studies can involve some stressful changes. These might include moving to a new area, meeting new people and managing on a tight budget.</p></button></a>

Yet for college students — as well as high school students and parents craning for a glimpse down the road — these changes can also be stressful. Overnight, college students separate from their traditional support system of family and friends. They also face many new challenges, such as living with roommates, managing heavy workloads, and developing an independent identity. It's no surprise that anxiety often spikes during college. So, what do we know about anxiety during the college years? How can you cope if you're facing it? And can you take steps this summer to help you handle anxiety when you head off to — or back to — a college campus?</p></button></a>

In a daze, you scan the same dull paragraph four times before you realize that you aren't actually reading the text. Your head is pounding and you cannot concentrate as you count down the final hours, minutes and then seconds until you need to be relaying your knowledge on paper.

                        <p>We all have moments where our social skills fail us. Perhaps your joke was greeted with awkward silence. Or, at a restaurant, you enthusiastically told the waiter that they, too, should enjoy their meal. 
    
                        The odd mishap with friends is hardly cause for alarm. The embarrassment will soon transform into an inside joke, deeping your bond with others.
                        
                        But, if you fumble too often, it can take a toll on your self-esteem and mental health. If you don't know how to improve your social skills, it can hold you back socially and at work. Some behaviors can come across as antisocial or even harmful to others, while simple shyness can read as aloof, standoffish, or arrogant. Knowing this might not put you at ease, but it can help you understand other people's reactions.</p></button></a>
